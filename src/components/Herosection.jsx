      <strong>Khoja Kya</strong> is a community-driven platform dedicated to helping
      individuals report and recover lost belongings with ease. Our mission is to
      build a trusted space where people can quickly report both
      <span class="font-semibold text-indigo-600">lost</span> and
      <span class="font-semibold text-green-600">found</span> items, connect with others
      in the community, and increase the chances of reuniting with their possessions.
      Whether it’s a misplaced phone, valuable documents, or a personal keepsake, we
      aim to make the process <em>simple, transparent, and effective</em> —
      bringing peace of mind to those in need.
